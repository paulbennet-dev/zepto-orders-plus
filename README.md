## Why this extension is created 🤔

- I needed a monthly summary of my orders on Zepto. So that I can plan what to pre-order or stock-up for the next month. This is not currently available in the Zepto app. Once this feature provided natively in Zepto, we can get rid of this extension happily.
- Also this is a POC of the above mentioned feature. So that its easy to understand how to implement this feature in the Zepto app.

## Todos ✅

- [] Repeat order placement from the monthly summary.
